# Student ERP System - Full-Stack Application

This is a comprehensive, full-stack Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system designed to manage core academic operations for an educational institution. The application features distinct, role-based interfaces and functionalities for both administrators and students, providing a centralized platform for managing student data, academic schedules, grades, attendance, and feedback.

The backend is built with a secure, stateless RESTful API using Spring Boot, while the frontend is a dynamic and responsive Single Page Application (SPA) built with React.
